This project allows you to test out facial analysis with the deepface Python package. 
It's important to note that deepface relies on Tensorflow, which currently only works with Python 3.7â€“3.10. Learn more about installing tensorflow [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install#:~:text=TensorFlow%20is%20tested%20and%20supported,or%20later%20(with%20C%2B%2B%20redistributable)).

This model also seems to have some biases that are apparent. For a number of images of Black women that I tested the model labeled their gender as male. This was not the case for the images of White women I tested. There are also many other ethical issues connected to facial recognition and analysis. Please keep this in mind and read more on this topic [here](https://learn.g2.com/ethics-of-facial-recognition#:~:text=The%20top%20six%20ethical%20concerns,breaches%2C%20and%20inefficient%20legal%20support.).
